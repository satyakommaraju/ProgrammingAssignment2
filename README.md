Repository for Programming Assignment 2 for R Programming on Coursera


Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix.Create benefit by caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly.

Write the following functions:

makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

 Other: Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.
